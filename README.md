# cse547-final-project

item-item.py generates gamma matrix where each row represents a uer and each column represents a movie each element is the predicted rating of the movie from the user 

insert_score_cb.py inserts the predicted score from the gammas matrix generated by item-item.py into the final table that contains all the predicted score from different model. 

linear_reg.py takes the cb and cf scores from the final big table and generate a linear regression hybrid model to predict scores for each user movie pair. 

rmsc_eval.py calculates the root mean square error of the hybrid model by comparing the order of the recommended movies and the actual order of the preference for any given user. 


Folders:
dictionary_data folder contains 3 dictionarys. movieId_to_movieIndex.npy is mapping a movie id to an index in the Gamma index generated by item-item.py. movieIndex_to_movieId.npy is the reverse of movieId_to_movieIndex.npy. user_movies.npy is mapping one user id to the 20 most recently rated movies by that user.
